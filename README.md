Python Practice Repository üêç

Welcome to my Python Practice repository! This repository contains various Python scripts and projects that I have been practicing to improve my programming skills. It‚Äôs a mix of small exercises, fun projects, and learning experiments.

üìö About

I am using this repository to practice Python coding by solving problems, learning new concepts, and building small projects. This helps me strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals, algorithms, and real-world applications.

The exercises and concepts are inspired by the LinkedIn Learning course: Level Up Python
.

üõ† Topics Covered

    Python basics: variables, data types, loops, conditionals

    Functions and recursion

    Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets

    String and list manipulation

    File handling

    Modules and libraries

    Object-oriented programming (OOP)

    Time, random, and other built-in modules

    Problem-solving exercises and mini projects

‚ö° Example Projects

    Timing Game: Test your sense of time using time.perf_counter()

    Nested List Search: Find elements in nested lists recursively

    String Sorting: Sort strings with case-insensitive methods

    Other Python exercises: Small functions and scripts to practice concepts

    (More projects and scripts will be added continuously as I learn.)
