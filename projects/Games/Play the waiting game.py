"""
ðŸ§  Simple Explanation

target = random.randint(2, 4)
â†’ Chooses a random wait time between 2â€“4 seconds.

First input()
â†’ Starts the game when you press Enter.

time.perf_counter()
â†’ Records the most accurate current time in seconds.

Second input()
â†’ You press Enter again when you think the target time passed.

elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start
â†’ Calculates how long you actually waited.

Tolerance check (abs(elapsed - target) <= 0.1)
â†’ Allows for small timing differences (within Â±0.1 sec).

Prints feedback:

Perfect (if within tolerance)

Too fast

Too slow
